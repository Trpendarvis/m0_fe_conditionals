# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
I am enjoying using comparison operators so far to my understanding I have not had much trouble using them as intended. I
do think that comparison operators are much more straight forward and easy to understand vs other concepts learned today.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
Currently I am struggling with combining things like if statements and logical operators, this was the last thing I did at night and it was very late at night so I think I was tired and missing a small piece somewhere which is causing me more problems than I assume I should be having. I understand what they should be doing but I am having difficulty executing code using logical operators. I will refresh myself in the morning when I am felling more awake.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
I would say I am easily a 3/5 I know I have lots of room for improvement but I feel like my current understanding is solid.

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
In all I did not spend too much time on this whole topic, there was a lot to do but I feel like I moved through it at a very good pace. I did have several hang ups throughout the day which lead to me needing to step away for a little longer than a normal break but I do think it helped me jump back into working more effectively. I believe it took around 2 hours from start to finish to finish this task. Currently it is far too late at night but I wanted to be sure I finished everything on my list.

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
Today I think my biggest lesson is that I really do need to take breaks seriously so I can better manage my mental fatigue so I can keep a better pace without needing to block out a large break time to reset myself. Being a veteran and being very busy with everything else in life I am very conditioned to never take breaks even through I know the importance. As I am sure I will need to continue to practice coding, I do feel like it is really starting to click and I am learning a ton in such a short amount of time. As for my calendar I really do not know how long things will or should take me to do but I am learning how to pace better as I go.

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
Code, code, code. Whenever a new topic is introduced I feel like a lot more code comes up that wasn't clearly or directly shared which means I have to research and look up how to do many basic things. As I continue I am, of course learning, a lot and will continue to keep following along and do my best :)
